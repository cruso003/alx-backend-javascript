## Introduction
This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive guide and hands-on experience in backend development using JavaScript. Through various projects and exercises, you will learn essential concepts and skills needed to build robust and scalable backend systems.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v12.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later) or yarn (v1.x or later)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
```
alx-backend-javascript/
â”œâ”€â”€ 0x00-ES6_basic/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 0-constants.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ 0x01-advanced/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ async_await.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ 0x02-databases/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mongodb_setup.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```
Each directory represents a module or a project. Inside each module, you will find:
- A `README.md` file explaining the module's objectives and tasks
- JavaScript files containing the code for the tasks
- A `package.json` file for managing dependencies

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cruso003/alx-backend-javascript.git
   cd alx-backend-javascript
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the code:**
   You can run the JavaScript files using Node.js:
   ```sh
   node path/to/your/file.js
   ```

## Usage
Each module contains specific tasks that you need to complete. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file of each module to understand the objectives and how to implement the solutions. You can use the provided scripts to test your code.
